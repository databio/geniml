# Genomic interval toolkit

## Introduction

`gitk` is a suite of tools for applying machine learning approaches to genomic interval data. For example, it can do things like building HMMs, assessing genomic interval universes, calculating likelihoods of consensus genomic interval sets, and computing single-cell clusters. It also provides a variety of other useful ancillary tools for working with genomic intervals to support these functions.

## Install

```
pip install --user --upgrade .
```

## Modules

`gitk` is organized into modules. The next section is an overview of each module. You can also proceed to the how-to guides for recipes on how to do specfic tasks.
