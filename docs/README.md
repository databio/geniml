# Genomic interval toolkit

## Introduction

`gitk` is a suite of tools for applying machine learning approaches to genomic interval data. For example, it can do things like building HMMs, assessing genomic interval universes, calculating likelihoods of consensus genomic interval sets, and computing single-cell clusters. It also provides a variety of other useful ancillary tools for working with genomic intervals to support these functions.

## Install

```
pip install --user --upgrade .
```

## Modules

`gitk` is organized into modules. You can read the list of functions by module, or proceed to the how-to guides, using the menu bar on the left.
