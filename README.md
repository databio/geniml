# Genomic interval machine learning (geniml)

Geniml is a python package for building machine learning models of genomic interval data (BED files). It also includes ancillary functions to support other types of analyses of genomic interval data.

Documentation is hosted at [geniml.databio.org](http://geniml.databio.org/en/latest/) (source in `/docs`).

## Development

Run tests (from `/tests`) with `pytest`. Please read the [contributor guide](https://geniml.databio.org/en/latest/contributing/) to contribute.
